Received_points are the number of points received by a server since uptime. And the selected points are the total number of queried points since uptime After a restart these counters are reset to zero.

We only allow dropping a server which has a replica since scaling down in number of pools is currently not supported. A server needs to be turned off before it can be dropped.
Note
When having two servers in a pool, let&amp;rsquo;s call them siri1 and siri2 and for some reason siri2 is broken and does not start. You might be in a situation where siri1 is waiting for siri2 to connect and start to synchronize data.</description></item></channel></rss>
