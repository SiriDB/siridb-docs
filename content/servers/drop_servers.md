Can be used to remove a server. We only allow dropping a server which has a
replica since scaling down in number of pools is currently not supported.
A server needs to be turned off before it can be dropped.

>**Note**

>When having two servers in a pool, let's call them **siri1** and **siri2** and for some
>reason **siri2** is broken and does not start. You might be in a situation where
>**siri1** is waiting for **siri2** to connect and start to synchronize data. Both
>servers are not working in this case but when dropping **siri2**, **siri1** removes
>the *'wait for synchronization'* status and starts accepting inserts and queries.

### Syntax

    drop server <server_uuid / server_name>

### Example

    # Drop server 'siri2:9010'. We first need to turn off
    # this server and make sure the server has a replica.
    drop server 'siri2:9010'
