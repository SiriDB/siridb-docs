# Series

Everything about Series is discussed here.

**Series** or **time series** can be seen as lists of data points. These time series in SiriDB are uniquely identified by name and can have any number of points. A single point consists of a timestamp and value. SiriDB supports time series for numeric data types (integer or float) and strings. Time series can be queried by name, regular expressions or dynamic groups.
