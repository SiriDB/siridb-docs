# SiriDB

[Transceptor Technology](https://transceptor.technology), a Dutch software startup, is proud to announce SiriDB to the world. This time series database is created to analyze and aggregate time series data from any source, from IoT to financial transactions to any other metric data stream. SiriDB is a fully open sourced time series database written in native C. Optimized to grow with your insert and query needs, SiriDB gives you the control over endless time series data. Time series data occurs wherever the same measurements are recorded on a regular basis. Common examples are temperature, rainfall, cpu usage, stock prices, and even sun spots.

## Main features

**Robust** - SiriDB's clustering mechanism provides the possibility to update and maintain the database while remaining online.

**Scalable** - SiriDB is scalable by using a unique pool mechanism that allows pools to be added on the fly when needed. When a pool is added; data is automatically divided evenly over all available pools providing optimal usage of all available computing resources.

**Fast** - SiriDB uses an unique algorithm to store its time series data without using bulky indexes. This algorithm allows the custom query language to distribute queries over all pools making data retrieval incredibly fast.

SiriDB with a multiple nodes clustering function is available as open source under the MIT license. It gives you the opportunity to analyze data by revealing trends, patterns, cycles, anomalies and outliers that will make an organization much more responsive and efficient.
