Database users have access to a SiriDB database and can insert and query data.

You can connect and work with a database via the [SiriDB http tool](https://github.com/SiriDB/siridb-http), [SiriDB prompt](https://github.com/SiriDB/siridb-prompt) or using one of the options mentioned in the section [Connect](../../connect).

Every new SiriDB database has already one default user account installed:  **iris** user with password **siri**.
