This means that offline servers are ignored and replica servers are included in the query. It&amp;rsquo;s also possible to count the shards size in case you want to see the amount of disk-space the shards are using.
Syntax count shards [size] [where ...] Examples # Get number of shards count shards # Get number of shards for the current points.</description></item><item><title>drop shards</title><link>https://docs.siridb.com/shards/drop_shards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.siridb.com/shards/drop_shards/</guid><description>Drops an existing shard using the shard id (sid). Use list shards for an overview of the current shards. This statement requires all pools to have at least one online server. The number of dropped shard in the result message only contains the dropped shards of one member of a pool, not the shards which are dropped by a replica. This is different from the count shards statement which includes the shards on replica servers as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
